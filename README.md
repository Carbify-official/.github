# Carbify

This GitHub organization hosts the internal software platforms developed by Carbify and its affiliated products.

Development within this organization has been ongoing since 2023 and supports multiple live products across climate technology, Web3 infrastructure, and interactive platforms.

## Scope of development

The Carbify codebase spans a broad and mature technical landscape, currently consisting of 31 private repositories, including:

- Multiple frontend applications and dashboards  
- Multiple backend services and APIs  
- Carbon accounting, certification, and registry systems  
- Blockchain infrastructure, including more than 50 production smart contracts  
- Game-related platforms and on-chain integrations  
- Data pipelines, replication flows, and automation services  

These repositories together form a multi-year, production-grade software stack.

## Repository visibility

All repositories in this organization are private by design.

This is a deliberate choice to protect intellectual property, security-sensitive logic, and production infrastructure. As a result, repository names, source code, and internal documentation are not publicly listed.

## Development activity and contributions

Development is performed by a team of developers working across multiple environments.

GitHub contribution graphs may show limited public activity, as a significant portion of day-to-day development takes place on internal development platforms, partner-controlled environments, or client-specific infrastructures. This organization primarily serves as the canonical source of record for reviewed, production-bound code.

Private contributions are enabled on individual contributor profiles and reflect ongoing work across Carbify’s internal platforms.

## Access and due diligence

Read-only access to selected repositories can be granted for technical due diligence, audits, or partnerships, subject to approval and applicable confidentiality agreements.
