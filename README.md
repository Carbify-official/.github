# Carbify

This GitHub organization hosts the internal software platforms developed by Carbify and its affiliated products.

Our repositories cover a broad range of production systems, spanning Web2 and Web3 infrastructure, climate and carbon-related platforms, and interactive applications built on top of blockchain and traditional cloud architectures.

## Scope of development

The software maintained within this organization includes, among others:

- Carbon accounting, certification, and registry systems  
- Smart contracts and supporting Web3 infrastructure  
- Dashboards and business portals for internal and external stakeholders  
- APIs and backend services powering consumer and partner-facing products  
- Game-related platforms and on-chain integrations  
- Data pipelines, replication flows, and automation services  

These systems are actively developed and maintained as part of live products and ongoing initiatives.

## Repository visibility

All repositories in this organization are private by design.

This is a deliberate choice to protect intellectual property, production logic, and security-sensitive components. As a result, repository names, source code, and internal documentation are not publicly listed.

## Development activity

Active development can be verified through the contributor profiles of Carbify team members. Private contributions are enabled on individual profiles and reflect continuous work across our internal platforms, including frequent updates, refactors, and feature development.

## Access and due diligence

Read-only access to specific repositories can be granted on request for audits, technical due diligence, or partnerships, subject to approval and applicable confidentiality agreements.
